# Quadcopter-Development-Project
Hello!

I am working on this project in order to familiarize myself with all the programming skills required to build an Arduino-controlled
quadcopter. I am starting with very basics, so I will understand clearly everything I make during the project. My major goal is to
use the quadcopter for my masters degree thesis in mechanical engineering.
